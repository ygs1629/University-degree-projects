## Overview
This repository contains a partial version of my Bachelorâ€™s Thesis (in Spanish), focusing on classifying IBEX 35 stocks according to investor risk profiles (conservative, neutral, tolerant).

### Objective
- Classify stocks for different investor risk profiles using decision trees and random forests.

### Data
- Monthly financial data (2016â€“2024): returns, volatility, Sharpe ratio, PER, Jensenâ€™s alpha.

### Techniques
- Decision Trees (`rpart`)  
- Random Forest (bagging, feature importance)  
- Stratified cross-validation with hyperparameter tuning

### Evaluation Metrics
- AUC, F1-score, sensitivity, specificity, confusion matrices

### Major Findings
- Credit rating, Sharpe ratio, and accumulated returns are key factors for stock inclusion/exclusion.

### Some Key Visual Takeaways
#### ROC Curves
