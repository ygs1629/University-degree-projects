# 🎓 University Degree Projects  

This repository brings together three of some of the projects that I have developed during my university studies.  
Although each project addresses a different domain (decision trees, forecasting, natural language processing), they all share the same motivation: **applying the statistical, machine learning and data analysis techniques learned at university to real-world problems**.  

---

## 🌟 Why this repository?  
- 📂 To group in a single place a representative piece of the work done from my Bachelor’s degree.  
- 🧠 To showcase how I combined **theory** with **practical implementation**.  
- 💡 To highlight transferable skills in **data preprocessing, modeling, evaluation, visualization and interpretation**.
